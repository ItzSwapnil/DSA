The preorder traversal of a binary search tree is 15, 10, 12, 11, 20, 18, 16, 19. What will
be the postorder traversal of the tree?

            15
            /\
           /  \
         10    20
          \     /
           \    18
            12  /\
            /  /  \
           /  16   19
          11

Post order traversal: 11, 12, 10, 16, 19, 18, 20, 15
