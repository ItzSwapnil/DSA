5. Suppose the numbers 7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2 are inserted in that order into an initially
empty binary search tree. The binary search tree uses the usual ordering on natural
numbers. What is the in-order traversal sequence of the resultant tree?

         7
       /   \
      /     \
     5       8
    / \     /
   1   6   9
      / \
     3   4
      \
       2
      /
     0

 In-Order : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
